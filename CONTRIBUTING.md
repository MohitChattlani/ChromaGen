# Contributing to this project

## Rules

If you want to start working on an issue, add a comment and either [gyanl](https://github.com/gyanl)
or [manu-chroma](https://github.com/manu-chroma) will assign the issue to you. To avoid duplicacy of work, don't work on an issue until it's assigned to you.

Apart from that, it's a pretty small project, and as long as what you do works, it'll be accepted. 
Hack on!

Also, feel free to add your name to the contributors list https://github.com/gyanl/ChromaGen#contributors :)
